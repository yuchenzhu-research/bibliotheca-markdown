### Curator's Note
Through the backpropagation algorithm, multi-layer neural networks could finally handle complex, non-linear realities. Much like da Vinci dissecting bodies to understand muscle traction, researchers found a way for weights to self-correct via mathematical gradients. From this point on, deep learning transformed from a mere concept into an evolving force.
