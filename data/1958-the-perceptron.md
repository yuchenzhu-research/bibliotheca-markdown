### Curator's Note
The Perceptron was not merely an algorithm; it was the "start-up moment" of digital intelligence. Akin to the early Renaissance exploration of perspective, it attempted to simulate neuronal impulses using simple weighted logic. Though initially limited to understanding a linear world, it laid the physical foundation for all subsequent neural networks.
