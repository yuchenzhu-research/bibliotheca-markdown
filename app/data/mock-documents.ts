        description: "The foundational text on the laws of motion and universal gravitation.",

        year: "1687",
        author: "Isaac Newton",
        focalY: 15,
        imageScale: 1.1,
        academicContext: "Newton's work replaced the indeterminate qualitative explanations of physics with a quantitative, mathematical approach. By unifying terrestrial and celestial mechanics under a single set of laws, he laid the framework for the Enlightenment's view of a predictable, 'clockwork' universe. This document is the cornerstone of classical physics.",

        author: "Leonardo da Vinci",
        focalY: 20,
        imageScale: 1.2,
        academicContext: "Da Vinci's illustration perfectly embodies the Renaissance concept of 'Man as the measure of all things.' Beyond its artistic merit, it reflects an early anatomical rigor and a philosophical belief in the divine symmetry of nature, bridging the gap between artistic expression and scientific observation.",

        focalY: 20,
        imageScale: 1.15,
        academicContext: "This text famously led to Galileo's trial for heresy. It is a masterpiece of scientific persuasion, using dialogue to dismantle the Earth-centric model. It represents the historic transition from dogma-based natural philosophy to empirical, observation-led science.",

        focalY: 10,
        imageScale: 1.1,
        academicContext: "Often cited as the most successful and influential textbook ever written. Euclid established the axiomatic method, proving complex theorems from simple, self-evident assumptions. For over two millennia, it defined the logical structure of human reason and mathematical thought.",

        academicContext: "Plato's Republic is the definitive text on political philosophy. Through the allegory of the cave and the theory of forms, it explores the nature of truth, the definition of justice, and the ideal structure of society, influencing every major political theorist in Western history.",
