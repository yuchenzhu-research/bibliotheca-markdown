abstract: "We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions."

### Core Insight

The invention of skip connections allowed neural networks to scale past the vanishing gradient barrier into hundreds of layers.
